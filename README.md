# README

It's just a collection of solutions to coding problems
on some well-known online judge platforms or contests.
Use _Makefiles_ to automate compilation, 
see _Makefile_ and _branch.mk_ for more information.

The solutions are based on a library 
inspired by _C interfaces and implementations_,
and wrote in literate program form.

Maintainance of infrastructure and solving of problems
are separated to different branches,
to clone the infrastructure separately is possible,
check out branch _infra_ if you want.
